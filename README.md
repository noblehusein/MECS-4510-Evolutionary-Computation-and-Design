# MECS-4510-Evolutionary-Computation-and-Design
In the course of Evoltuionarry computation and design we explore, the various applications of Genetic algorithms and different areas in which they can be
applied.

TSP: We attempt to solve the age old travelling salesman Problem with a custom made Evolutionary algorithm that uses a list representation to search the shortest
     distance between different cities.

Symbolic Regression: We look at a classic example of a Genetic programing problem. Where we evolve a tree representation to a mathematical expression that
                     fits a certain series of points with minimum error.

Soft Robotics: first step in this project is to create a physics simulator with gravity, damping and friction, from scratch. And then model a simple cube and make it bounce.
               Following which we then made robots with arbitrary configurations of masses and springs. We chose to evolve the gait of a snake like robots.
